# Login / Register Simple System

This is my first pet project.
It is a simple window application for login and registration.<br>
Swing, MySQL and Java were used in the development.
The user enters data in the login window (username and password) and if such a user is in the database, then the login is successful, otherwise we get a message window with an error.<br>
The user also has the ability to register if the user is not in the database. To do this, click on the text below and fill in the appropriate fields and click the "register" button.
The password and username must be at least 6.<br>
After this, the user is transferred to the login window where he can log in to the system.
